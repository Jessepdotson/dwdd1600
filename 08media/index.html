            <h1>Introduction</h1>
            <p>Darkwood National Park, once a pristine and cherished natural gem of the United States, now stands as a testament to the challenges and complexities of preserving our nation's natural treasures. This defunct national park, situated in the heart of the American Midwest, bore witness to a unique history that ultimately led to its closure. This document aims to provide a comprehensive historical overview of Darkwood National Park, shedding light on its establishment, key milestones, and <strong>its unfortunate demise</strong>.</p>
        <h1>History</h1>
            <h2>Establishment and Early Years (1935-1950)</h2>
        <p>Darkwood National Park was established on June 20, 1935, during the era of President Franklin D. Roosevelt, as part of the New Deal's effort to create jobs and conserve the nation's natural resources. Spanning over 200,000 acres in the state of Kansas, the park was named after the dense, ancient forests of oak, hickory, and pine that characterized its landscape.

In its early years, the park thrived, attracting nature enthusiasts, hikers, and campers from across the country. The park's rangers worked diligently to maintain its trails, preserve the ecosystem, and provide educational programs to visitors.</p>
            <h2>Challenges and Controversies (1950-1970)</h2>
            <p>The 1950s marked a period of significant change for Darkwood National Park. As the nation's population grew and urbanization expanded, the park faced increased pressures from neighboring communities seeking access to its resources for logging, mining, and recreational activities. Conflicts arose between park management, local businesses, and environmental advocates over the park's future direction.

During this period, the park's infrastructure also faced challenges, including outdated visitor facilities and limited accessibility. These issues contributed to a decline in visitation and a growing disillusionment among park enthusiasts. <a href="Merchandise.html#merchandise">Artifacts from the park are available for purchase at the CLAMO merchandise store.</a>        </p>
            <p><em>Despite rumors no persons went missing during this time.</em></p>
            
            <h2>The Missing 151</h2>
            <p>On the morning of April 11th 1971, 151 individuals mysteriously dissapeared from the park. </p>
        
            <h2>CLAMO co. Saves the Park (1971-2002)</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li> While certian areas of the park are still closed to civilians, CLAMO has opened up designated recreation areas and hiking trails! </li>
                    <li> CLAMO begins use of Darkwood National Park as a <em>product testing</em> area.</li>
                    <li>In 1999 CLAMO begins to restrict access to the park even further.</li>
                    <li>2002 - all non essential CLAMO employee access to the park is denied.</li>
                </ul>
